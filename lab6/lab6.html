<br>
<img src= "favicon.jpg" width="200px>"
<br> <p> Favicon is short for “Favorite Icon”, it's literally the little, tiny graphic that you see in the tabs in your browser, the URL bar, in your bookmarks, and appears typically at a whopping 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 pixels.</p>

<a href= "https://www.lcn.com/blog/beginners-guide-favicons/#:~:text=Favicons%20are%20the%20small%20square,used%20to%20represent%20a%20brand."> <b> 2. How are favicons created? </b> </a>
<br>
<p> Favicons are the small square images that are usually displayed
	 before the URL in the address bar of a browser, in the browsing tabs, and next to the site name in a user’s list of bookmarks. Usually, they're just the brand or website logo shrunk down to 16 x 16 pixels, but any image can be used to represent a brand.</p>
	<a href= "https://studio.code.org/s/pixelation"> <b> 3. How did I create the favicon for this site? </b> </a>
	 <br>
	 <p>When creating the logo for the website, I decided to use my initial, ‘P’. To begin with I set the width and length to 16 and 6 bits per pixel to start creating the logo I want.
